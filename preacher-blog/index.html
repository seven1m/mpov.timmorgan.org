This year, we launched our new website, we launched a Facebook-clone site for members (I won&rsquo;t bother providing a link since you can&rsquo;t sign in anyway &ndash; but trust me, it&rsquo;s cool), we just finished revamping and reorganizing our <a href=http://cedarridgecc.com/resources/podcasts title="Cedar Ridge Christian Church Podcasts">podcast section</a>, and now our staff is starting to blog.</p><p>I think Greg said it perfectly&mldr; we&rsquo;re not wanting to follow a fad &ndash; we&rsquo;re simply hoping to make the best use of the tools we have before us. And the fact that normal people (not just geeks) are utilizing the Web for more than just school research and ebay purchases is pretty darn cool to me.</p><p>It seems all the work Jennie and I have been a part of for the past several years is finally converging and helping (albeit in a tiny way) to strengthen the church body as a whole.</p></div></section></main><footer id=footer><div class=copyright>© Copyright
