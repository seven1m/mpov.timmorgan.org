And that&rsquo;s what I figured out!</p><p><p class=markdown-image><img src=/images/ipad_and_pi_and_printer.jpg alt="Dymo printer next to a Raspberry Pi computer and an iPad running Planning Center Check-Ins"></p></p><h2 id=how-it-works>How it works <a href=#how-it-works class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><p>I installed Raspbian Linux on my Raspberry Pi 4 with VNC Viewer and a virtual console. That means that when the Pi boots up, there is a virtual desktop created, even though you cannot see it unless you plug in a monitor.</p><p>CUPS is installed with the proper Dymo driver, so it&rsquo;s a matter of plugging in the Dymo printer and adding it in either the web UI or on the command line.</p><p>I also installed Planning Center Check-Ins on Linux. This is possible because the app is an <a href=https://www.electronjs.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Electron</a> application that can be compiled for multiple platforms.</p><h2 id=the-lag-problem-and-solution>The lag problem (and solution) <a href=#the-lag-problem-and-solution class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><p>Everything mostly worked at this point, but there was a major lag in between printing labels. The first label would print within a second or two, which is acceptable. However, any subsequent labels would be delayed by up to 10 seconds!</p><p>I spent a full day trying to track down the issue inside CUPS, changing the printer to print in different modes, trying different drivers, etc.</p><p>Finally I resorted to a hack, which works beautifully. <a href=https://github.com/seven1m/rpi-check-in-printer/blob/master/dymo_lag_fix.rb target=_blank rel=noopener>This script</a> runs on startup and constantly monitors running processes. When it determines that a label was printed, but the <code>usb://</code> process that printed it still laying around, it kills the process.</p><p>This is ugly, but it really works. I don&rsquo;t know if this is a bug in CUPS, or what, but I suspect it&rsquo;s a bug in the Dymo print driver. In any case, someone much smarter than I could probably find the actual cause of the lag. In the meantime, my hacky script will keep on running, killing the stuck process as needed.</p><h2 id=instructions>Instructions <a href=#instructions class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><p>The whole thing is <a href=https://github.com/seven1m/rpi-check-in-printer target=_blank rel=noopener>documented on GitHub</a>, along with a video walk-through:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH3Qwt0vvbc&feature=youtu.be" target=_blank rel=noopener><p class=markdown-image><img src=/images/rpi_printer_video_tn.jpg alt="YouTube Video walk-through"></p></a></p><p>If you are a tech at your church and you&rsquo;d like to use this solution, please give it a go. Also, let me know! I would be encouraged to hear if any other churches find it useful.</p></div><div class=tags><a href=https://mpov.timmorgan.org/tags/raspberrypi>raspberrypi</a>
