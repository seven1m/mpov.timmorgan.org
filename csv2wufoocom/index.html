Gathering submissions is only one small trick in its bag of 'em &ndash; Wufoo's reporting makes it a really good platform for visualizing flattened data, among other things. Staff in our church use Wufoo in ways they should probably be using Excel, but Wufoo makes it so much easier.<p>With csv2wufoo, we should now have a better way of getting data into the system.</p></div></section></main><footer id=footer><div class=copyright>© Copyright
