sudo apt-get install fetchmail postfix cd ~ vim .fetchmailrc Add the following to the file (replacing everything in CAPS appropriately):
poll pop.gmail.com with proto POP3 and options no dns user 'YOUR_GMAIL_ADDRESS' there with password 'YOUR_PASSWORD' is 'YOUR_UBUNTU_USERNAME' here options ssl Now:
chmod 710 .fetchmailrc sudo vim /etc/crontab Add the following to your crontab file:
10 7 * * 1 YOUR_UBUNTU_USERNAME fetchmail -k This will run fetchmail every Sunday and grab your email.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/google-search-everywhere-except-a-site/>Google Search Everywhere &lt;em>Except&lt;/em> a Site</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2007-12-13 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Dec 13, 2007</time></div></div><div class=summary>Just saw this in my referrer logs… You can search on Google for all occurrences except in a certain site.
Many know about adding site:timmorgan.org or similar to only search within a certain domain. Well, maybe it was obvious, but now I know you can do -site:timmorgan.org to search everywhere but that domain. Nice.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/social-networking-for-your-church/>Social Networking for Your Church</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2007-12-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Dec 1, 2007</time></div></div><div class=summary>Starting around mid- to late-2006, I started a little project for my church. The idea was to rewrite our existing online membership directory to make it more searchable and to take a stab at creating something somewhat social, where people can easily communicate with each other and also see their interests and such. Plus, I was dying to build something significant with Ruby on Rails, my new favorite web framework.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/mpovtimmorganorg/>mpov.timmorgan.org</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2007-11-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Nov 14, 2007</time></div></div><div class=summary>I used Wordpress.com’s nifty domain mapping feature and moved my blog to its own domain.

I have to use Outlook at work and yearn for the day that it will properly thread replies as Gmail does, but I digress…
Anyway, is it just me, or is the slightly “improved” Gmail actually dumber? Here are some pet peeves I’ve aquired in the last week of using the new Gmail: For one, the drop down menus (you know, for selecting an action on individual and/or selected email) are no longer real select lists; they’re instead some DHTML kind of thing that has a scroll bar that feels flimsy.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/find-andamp-replace-in-word-with-ruby/>Find &amp;amp; Replace in Word with Ruby</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2007-11-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Nov 12, 2007</time></div></div><div class=summary>You can script Microsoft Word using COM and the Ruby win32ole library.
First, create a plain Word document with text to replace like this:
Here is some text of my document. This will be replaced with [name]. Today’s date is: [date].
Then, run the following code. The text in square brackets will be replaced with the values in the code, and the file will be saved as a new name.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/ubuntu-710-rocks/>Ubuntu 7.10 Rocks</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2007-10-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Oct 17, 2007</time></div></div><div class=summary>The new Ubuntu rocks, let me tell you. For one reason: things just work. This is the first time I’ve ever installed a Linux OS and didn’t have to crack open the terminal to tweak XOrg settings or to manually install graphics drivers, etc. My wireless card worked, upgrading my graphics drivers was as simple as a few clicks in the GUI, and turning on Compiz effects was as a dream.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/politics-and-18-30-year-olds/>Politics and 18-30 Year-Olds</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2007-06-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 12, 2007</time></div></div><div class=summary>There seems to be a general dissatisfaction with politics amongst people my age. We have a bad taste in our mouths. We’ve grown up watching a political process that seems to only happen on our TVs. And we feel we have absolutely no power to influence it. Because it’s a one-way channel.
In some ways, the whole process is like a bad television show.
The things we learned in grade school and high school (at a time when we were too young to participate) made the system seem beautifully complex and perfectly designed.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/ron-paul-17/>Ron Paul</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2007-06-11 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 11, 2007</time></div></div><div class=summary>I’ve been seeing a lot on the Web about this guy named Ron Paul. He’s running for president in 2008, but first he has to get the Republican nomination. He has many supporters already, and I only see that growing over the next several months.
Ron Paul is the only politician I’ve read about who truly fights for individual rights and follows the constitution. He’s restored my hope for the country and for the Republican party.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/one-spotty-year-of-mpov/>One (Spotty) Year of MPOV</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2007-06-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 6, 2007</time></div></div><div class=summary>I just realized I’ve now had this blog for one year.
