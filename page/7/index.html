While I wouldn’t exactly call it “reliable” at the moment (its recent upgrade took it down for weeks and it’s service has been sketchy ever since), I could see it amassing a cult following among geeks like myself.
I’m still waiting on an API key so I can test my Flickr migration script. I wrote a bit of Ruby to download each of my Flickr photos, along with their tags, geotags, description, title, etc.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/wget-to-the-rescue/>wget to the rescue</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2007-03-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Mar 17, 2007</time></div></div><div class=summary>Have you ever been downloading something very large for a long time, and something happens to interrupt it? Firefox crashes, you lose power, you accidentally close your laptop lid, etc.? Here’s a trick to start your download where you left off: On Linux, you can skip this step. On Mac, download wget here, unzip it, and put “wget” in /usr/bin. For Windows, looks like you can download wget here (I haven’t tried this on Windows, but it shouldn’t be much different).</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/wikipedia-watchlist-feed-v2/>Wikipedia Watchlist Feed v2</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2007-02-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Feb 19, 2007</time></div></div><div class=summary>Update: I’ve been using this for awhile now, and I still have to manually check my watchlist every day because my reader only gets updates every few days.

I say this because, after watching tonight’s episode, the direction of the show has definitely changed. I think those writers finally figured out they don’t have blind followers – they have to get off their butts and actually move the story along. And that’s what they finally did tonight.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/music-sharing/>Music Sharing</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2007-02-07 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Feb 7, 2007</time></div></div><div class=summary>Dvorak is spot on about the music industry: During the heyday of Napster and open free music sharing and trading, when million of people swapped songs, the CD business was booming.

He also said something interesting to me that really got me thinking about how the Web has affected us the last few years:I’m not looking to be trendy. It [blogging] just seems to be an effective way to communicate with an ever-ambiguous, mobile congregation, and in a more interactive fashion.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/crcc-website-overhaul/>CRCC Website Overhaul</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2007-01-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jan 31, 2007</time></div></div><div class=summary>As we tend to do every couple years, Jennie and I have once again overhauled the website of Cedar Ridge Christian Church, our church home in Broken Arrow, OK.

Tag them with the word “breast.” I’m not kidding. I uploaded some crappy photos from our breastfeeding class two weeks ago; one has six times more views and other has over 25 times more views than all my other crappy photos. Just goes to show that for most people, the Internet is for porn.</div></section><div class=pagination><span class=prev><a href=/page/6/><span class=arrow>←</span> Newer posts</a></span>
