Almost every one has a screen or two somewhere that shows a listing, and at the bottom it has pagination links, e.g. next page, page 3, etc. For a recent app I’ve been working on, the interface is very search-driven, i.e. the user enters some criteria the results are displayed.
As an experiment, I left off the pagination links. In this app, there is no “next page.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/slicehost-affiliate-link/>SliceHost Affiliate Link</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2008-05-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">May 9, 2008</time></div></div><div class=summary>Just posting this for any friends getting ready to sign up for a SliceHost account.

git branch tells you which branch you’re on.
git branch -a lists all branches, even remote ones.
git checkout mybranch checks out the branch you want.
git checkout -b newbranch creates a new branch from the one you’re on, and checks it out for you.
git checkout master && git merge mybranch merges changes from one branch to your master branch.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/git-for-people-who-know-svn-things-ive-learne/>Git For People Who Know Svn (Things I've Learned, Part 1)</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2008-03-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Mar 1, 2008</time></div></div><div class=summary>First, the mental hurdles:You don’t need a server to have a git repository. All your commit history is available locally and quickly, with simple commands. Same with branches and tags. Git “checkout” and “commit” are commands you run locally. Svn “checkout” and “commit” are really more like “pull” and “push” with git.
Now, the commands:
rails myapp && cd myapp && git init && git add . && git commit -a creates a repo and makes the first commit (but still nothing is sent to any server; all work is done locally in your own repository)</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/advanced-ruby-on-rails/>Advanced Ruby on Rails</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2008-02-15 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Feb 15, 2008</time></div></div><div class=summary>I’ve been reading the book Advanced Rails by Brad Ediger. I first met Brad way back in 2006 when we were first trying to get our local Ruby user group going. He is a very smart fellow, and his newest book is definitely evidence of that. There’s a lot in there that’s over my head, but that’s nothing a few rereads can’t solve. :-)The book has everything from optimization to deployment, from security to metaprogramming (my brain is still spinning from that one).</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/onebody-blog/>OneBody Blog</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2008-02-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Feb 14, 2008</time></div></div><div class=summary>OneBody now has a real, bona fide blog of its own. Thanks to WordPress.com, creating a new blog is waaaay too easy, evidenced by the fact that I now have 37 (just kidding).
Our little project continues to grow and improve. I’m still waiting on that influx of talented, eager volunteers to make it awesome, though :-) For now, it will continue to be Tim’s pet project, though I refuse to stop referring to the development “team” as “we” and “us.</div></section><div class=pagination><span class=prev><a href=/page/4/><span class=arrow>←</span> Newer posts</a></span>
