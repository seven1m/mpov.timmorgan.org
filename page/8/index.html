I’m still sinking my roots deep into that thing, finding more and more old friends and people I forgot about (sorry; bad memory :-).
Particularly, I hope to find more college and high school friends and see what they’re up to these days.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/hpy/>Hpy</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-09-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Sep 18, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>I’m still running Hpy, a place to list things that make you happy. I still think the idea is simple and neat, though it has yet to reach critical mass. Go see my list here and think about adding your own.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/server-migration/>Server Migration</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-09-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Sep 14, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>I host a few low-traffic websites out of my house. One of them is actually a paying customer! The last few days, I’ve been working on migrating all my web apps/sites to a new server (still at my house). This time, though, I spent some time on the infrastructure to make things more reliable. I set up RAID 1 mirroring on my hard drives. I also utilized VMWare Server (free) and built a virtual server image.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/ruby-website-redesign/>Ruby Website Redesign</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-09-11 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Sep 11, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>My favorite programming language had a bit of a facelift.

This is amazing – to see the community value something I worked on for a big chunk of my life and desire that it continue on without me. It’s humbling and edifying at the same time! I wish them the best and hope they can take ZW places I never dreamed of.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/web-20-logo/>Web 2.0 Logo</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-08-26 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Aug 26, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>All those Web 2.0 logos are starting to look the same… so some guy went and created an app that generates them automatically…</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/code-snippet-comments-rss-feed/>Code Snippet Comments RSS Feed</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-08-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Aug 23, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>In my quest to make everything into a feed… I present the Code Snippet Comments feed. It goes with this site, which lacks a feed for comments posted on snippets.
For this feed generation, I used a free service called Feed43. It’s quite powerful! Basically, you give it a URL and about ten minutes of your life working out some pattern recognition, and voila! you get a feed auto generated every six hours based on the content of the page.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/wikipedia-watchlist-rss-feed/>Wikipedia Watchlist RSS Feed</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-08-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Aug 23, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>Update: Version 2 is available here.Today, I finally got fed up with Wikipedia’s lack of watchlist feeds, so I wrote a script that generates them.
A few of the photos I had uploaded to the Wikimedia Commons have been marked for deletion for some time now due to inadequate license information (my fault entirely), but I didn’t know it because I didn’t think about the Commons having its own separate watchlist.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/lightbox-with-iframes/>Lightbox with Iframes</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-08-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Aug 8, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>I needed a version of Lightbox that handled real web page urls instead of just images, so I hacked it myself. I looked into using Lightbox Gone Wild, but it seemed a misnomer; it’s more like a stripped down version of Lightbox. I like the effects and transitions of Lightbox, so I figured why not start there?I’d love to show you an example, but I don’t have a host for it right now.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/rush-hour-ethics/>Rush-Hour Ethics</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-08-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Aug 4, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>Here's a phenomenon that really peeves me. On my way home every weekday, I pass South through these two intersections. During rush-hour, traffic can get quite backed up here, so the wait can easily be ten or fifteen minutes at this one point in my drive home. What’s worse is that people cheat. As the second map below shows, people take a side road over to Peoria, turn South, then line up at the same intersection, but in a much shorter line.</div></section><div class=pagination><span class=prev><a href=/page/7/><span class=arrow>←</span> Newer posts</a></span>
