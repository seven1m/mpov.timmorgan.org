On my way home every weekday, I pass South through these two intersections. During rush-hour, traffic can get quite backed up here, so the wait can easily be ten or fifteen minutes at this one point in my drive home. What’s worse is that people cheat. As the second map below shows, people take a side road over to Peoria, turn South, then line up at the same intersection, but in a much shorter line.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/ziddlywiki/>ZiddlyWiki</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-08-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Aug 2, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>Update: The community has stepped up to take over development of ZiddlyWiki. So, it appears ZW will live on!
Update 11/7/2007: Ziddlywiki.com has been dead for a long time now. I really like TiddlyWiki and think there should be a solid server implementation like ZW was; make your plea in a comment on this post if you'd like to discuss a ZW comeback.
ZiddlyWiki was a product I built and maintained for awhile.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/mac-bragging/>Mac Bragging</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-07-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jul 14, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>I haven’t actually done anything with the new Mac, but I’ve sure had fun doing it! I’ve been a bit swamped with work lately, so my bandwidth for additional projects is near zero. I’ve managed to install all the geeky Mac tools and surf the web a lot.
Oh, and I worked last night to get all my photos (over 30GB worth!) in one place (on the Mac) so I can start sorting and archiving and such.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/new-mac/>New Mac</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-07-11 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jul 11, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>I’m writing this post from my brand spanking new MacBook Pro. Man O Man is this thing a piece of work. It’s simply beautiful. It feels solid, yet lightweight. It’s screen is absolutely flawless and can be seen surprizingly well from all angles. The keyboard illumination feature is kick-butt. Typing at night will never be the same (yes I know how to type, but doing programming requires a lot of arrow keys and symbols, and I can’t always find those in the dark).</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/switchers/>Switchers</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-07-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jul 6, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>Seems everybody who’s anybody these days is “switching” from one platform to another. Mark Pilgrim switched from Mac to Linux. Jamie Zawinski switched from Linux to Mac. Josh Marshall switched from Windows to Mac. And, well, I can’t think of anyone prominent who switched to Windows, but I’m sure everybody’s drooling over Vista.
My point is, over the last two years, I’ve felt less and less like a “switcher” and more like a tool collector.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/stephen-and-tim-day/>Stephen and Tim Day</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-06-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 27, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>Today was officially proclaimed "Stephen and Tim day" because of all our work lately on integrating our systems with the state of Oklahoma.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/the-team-3/>The Team</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-06-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 27, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>My coworker Joseph put this together.

I got an iPod for my birthday two months ago. And I love(d) it. I’ve become addicted to a handful of podcasts over the past few months and my collection of music has been slowly growing. My car radio has largely forgotten the sound of traditional broadcast radio.Yesterday, my iPod booted up with this icon. I took it back to Best Buy to get it exchanged, only to find out the extra fifty bucks spent on “extended service” or whatever they called it means they ship the iPod back to Apple for repair instead of making me do it.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/junk-email-filter-dot-com/>Junk Email Filter Dot Com</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-06-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 24, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>We just started using an email filtering service at Cedar Ridge. So far, I’m very pleased with it. In the two days it’s been in place, only a handful of spam messages have passed through to our server, and every one of those were filtered by our existing DNS blacklist filtering.
The filter works by proxy, meaning all mail destined for our domain is first delivered to junkemailfilter.com. Their server filters out the spam using some fancy voodoo and delivers the good stuff to our server.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/less-spam/>Less Spam</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-06-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 21, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>I have an ongoing experiment in which I never empty my Spam folder in Gmail. On the left side of the screen, when I log in, I can see how many spam messages I have. Gmail automatically deletes spam messages over thirty days old, so this is an accurate representation of how many spam messages I get in a given thirty-day period.When I first started using Gmail, my spam folder grew quickly to contain over five hundred spam messages!</div></section><div class=pagination><span class=prev><a href=/page/8/><span class=arrow>←</span> Newer posts</a></span>
