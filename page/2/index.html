Today I bit the bullet and decided to migrate my Posterous blog to Jekyll. There are many reasons I chose Jekyll ‚Äì independence from free hosted services is probably the biggest reason.
I chose to use Octopress, which extends Jekyll with a set of sane defaults and a good structure for customizing layout, CSS, etc.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/super-simple-clipboard-history-for-linux/>Super simple clipboard history for Linux.</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2012-11-07 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Nov 7, 2012</time></div></div><div class=summary>I recently switched from Gnome to i3 on my main laptop. So far, I'm enjoying the simplicity of piecing together my own desktop environment from small, specialized tools.
One thing I missed from Gnome was my clipboard history tool, Gpaste. I've come to expect that my previous dozen or more clipboard copies are a keystroke or two away and not lost forever.

jqtal is different because it is a part of and lives alongside the HTML itself. An example might help:
The plugin uses HTML5 data- attributes to embed data necessary for content insertion. Whereas in a normal template language, you might have something like:&lt;input name="first_name" value="{{ person.first_name }}"/>...in jqtal, you do this instead:&lt;input name="first_name" data-val="</div></section><div class=pagination><span class=prev><a href=/><span class=arrow>‚Üê</span> Newer posts</a></span>
