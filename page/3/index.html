For any of you using more than the tiniest amount of JavaScript in your web-based applications, Backbone.js may be something to consider. Backbone brings structure and organization to the client-side that we've long had in MVC frameworks on the server. Here are some benefits:Stores data in specialized data "models" instead of directly on the DOM.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/red-dirt-ruby-conference-ii/>Red Dirt Ruby Conference II</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2011-04-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Apr 23, 2011</time></div></div><div class=summary>Red Dirt Ruby Conference in nearby Oklahoma City was even better this year than last year, and that’s saying a lot.
The format of RDRC is unlike any other conference I’ve attended. The key difference: each speaker (excepting keynote speakers) only talks for 18 minutes and that’s it.
Speakers are grouped, four at a time, into a theme. This year’s themes (for day one, which is all I was able to attend) were Ruby Implementations, Rails 3 Extensions, Rails Redux, and JavaScript.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/auto-compile-sass-with-jammit/>Auto-Compile SASS with Jammit</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2011-04-13 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Apr 13, 2011</time></div></div><div class=summary>I won’t bother explaining to my regular readers what these two things are. If you need this, then you know… ;-)
I know that both SASS and Compass can be setup to “watch” a directory and auto-compile when files are changed, but it seemed a waste to me to have another thing I have to remember to launch.
This hack piggybacks on Jammit’s include_stylesheets helper method and compiles and .scss files in the public/stylesheets directory if they’ve changed since last time.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/david-brady-screencast-with-james-edward-gray/>David Brady Screencast with James Edward Gray II</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2011-04-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Apr 6, 2011</time></div></div><div class=summary>Just got done watching this excellent discussion of Ruby hashes, associative arrays, testing, and Ruby culture.Link.

Today I remembered it and thought I would tinker around a little, only to find out that when I logged into AWS console, I had to "re-activate" my account using a phone number. Hmmm, that's weird. I distinctly remember doing that two weeks ago. So I jumped through the hoops and got logged in again to discover that my instance was gone, my security group was gone, and my elastic ip was gone.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/winexe-on-ubuntu/>Winexe on Ubuntu</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2011-02-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Feb 24, 2011</time></div></div><div class=summary>If you're running a Linux desktop in an otherwise Windows environment, winexe may be something you'll enjoy.Winexe allows you to execute commands from a Linux machine on a remote Windows machine, as if you're sitting at the Windows command prompt.

Recently, I found a way to get it to compile on my beloved Ubuntu Maverick (it broke when I dist-upgraded for some reason), and I thought I'd share.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/use-a-proc-with-activerecords-defaultscope-me/>Use a Proc with ActiveRecords' default_scope Method</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2010-10-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Oct 19, 2010</time></div></div><div class=summary>Today, my small patch to Rails was applied by the core team. This is only my second contribution to Rails, so I’m fairly stoked about it being accepted.
This will allow you to pass a block to the default_scope method in ActiveRecord. It doesn’t sound like much, but opens up some wonderful possibilities.
First, a review of what default_scope does:
The first call to Person.all applies the default scope and adds a where clause that returns only non-deleted folks.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/use-rsync-instead-of-cp/>Use rsync instead of cp</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2010-05-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">May 9, 2010</time></div></div><div class=summary>I tend to use rsync when others would typically use a simple cp for copying files. A few reasons:
It can be canceled in the middle, and resumed later. It can show a progress bar that (while not perfect) is great for large files or lots of files. It will only copy the changed files and won’t clobber already existing directories of files at the target. rsync is available on Linux, Mac, and there’s a binary somewhere on teh intarwebs for Windows.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/red-dirt-ruby-conf/>Red Dirt Ruby Conf</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2010-05-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">May 6, 2010</time></div></div><div class=summary>Just some pics. :-)</div></section><div class=pagination><span class=prev><a href=/page/2/><span class=arrow>←</span> Newer posts</a></span>
