Part One will focus on where to find what in the Ruby community. With any programming language or framework, you have a set of resources you go to often to find what you’re looking for.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/whats-the-diff/>What's the Diff?</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-06-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 19, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>Interesting campaign, but surely they're not implying the BSOD only happens on non-pirated Windows software, are they?Speaking of BSOD, how did I ever miss this?

Too often I see people addicted to the Rails scaffolding feature. I've found that it's often a crutch for actually thinking about the problem at hand. Scaffolding is great for a one-table model, but breaks down quickly when you have has_manys and other such relationships.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/okrb-talk/>OK.rb Talk</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-06-13 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 13, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>I gave a talk tonight at the quarterly Oklahoma Ruby User Group meeting in Edmond.

This required a major overhaul of the code, but now that it's done (bar a few remaining bugs I'm sure), it should be much easier to add other translations later (as they are made available as web services).
I'm still tweaking the UI for working with the translations, so bare with me. Suggestions are welcome.
Later.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/tyrannical-inanimate-meathead/>Tyrannical, Inanimate Meathead</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-06-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 9, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>From now on, I'd appreciate it if you'd call me by my real name above.

Just go to your 43V "My Verses" page and add this to the URL: "?format=js". If you don't want all your verses listed, you can add another argument called "count" like this: "&count=10". So the full URL might look like this: http://43verses.com/users/show/1?format=js&count=10You can see an example of this in use at our family weblog.</div></section><div class=pagination><span class=prev><a href=/page/9/><span class=arrow>←</span> Newer posts</a></span>
