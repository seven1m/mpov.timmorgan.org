First, a new Seagate hard drive. 500gb, 7200rpm, $99 at Best Buy. It took about an hour to get my machine apart, with all its tiny screws, get the new drive in, and put it back together.
Next, I said good-bye to Mac OS X. I installed the brand new Ubuntu 10.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/whiteboard-icons/>Whiteboard Icons</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2010-03-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Mar 9, 2010</time></div></div><div class=summary>Back in 2005, I uploaded a bunch of crude little pictures to my Flickr account [edit 12 years later: this account is gone] and called them my “Whiteboard Icons” set. Hundreds of people have, over the years, found them to be useful on their blogs, flowcharts, and more.
Today, I finally added a couple new icons to the set. Only took me five years.
Enjoy.
Update: Various sizes and scalable versions are available in the whiteboard_icons git repository.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/csv2wufoocom/>csv2wufoo.com</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2010-03-07 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Mar 7, 2010</time></div></div><div class=summary>csv2wufoo.com is a little side project I wrote using Sinatra, my WufooParty lib, and James Edward Gray's FasterCSV lib.

Why reinvent the wheel?
It's fun.I always learn something.
Sometimes I learn to not reinvent the wheel.But sometimes I learn so much more. The libraries out there I spent 10 minutes looking at didn't seem to fully support application authentication.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/campaignmonitor-api-wrapper/>CampaignMonitor API Wrapper</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2009-06-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 28, 2009</time></div></div><div class=summary>Update: This was renamed to campaign_monitor_party.
First of all, HTTParty is simply amazing. That is all.Second, Ruby never ceases to amaze me regarding its power and tools for meta-programming. "method_missing" is just too cool. Third, I created a 20-line wrapper class for the Campaign Monitor API this weekend (using HTTParty). The code and the gem is over on GitHub: http://github.com/seven1m/campaign_monitor_party.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/cascadingrubies-ruby-dsl-for-generating-css/>CascadingRubies - Ruby DSL for generating CSS</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2009-06-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 4, 2009</time></div></div><div class=summary>I’ve been working on a little experiment lately… a Ruby domain-specific language for generating Cascading Style Sheets called CascadingRubies.

To get Prototype to run after squeezing it through ShrinkSafe, you need to put back every instance of the variable $super. ShrinkSafe replaces variable names with shortened versions, and because of some Prototype voodoo, it breaks on this one name. There are about 8 places you’ll find it, and unfortunately, it takes some manual hunting once ShrinkSafe has changed a bunch of names, but there you have it.</div></section><div class=pagination><span class=prev><a href=/page/3/><span class=arrow>←</span> Newer posts</a></span>
