I'm thinking about adding them to 43V. I get chills just imagining the list of available translations growing as more translations are made available as web services. Of course, the big kahuna would be NIV, but I doubt Zondervan would ever make their content freely available. Pay per word, maybe, but never free. That's a shame.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/my-name-in-flickr/>My Name in Flickr</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-06-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 6, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>This app is cool:</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/43v-bookmarklet/>43V Bookmarklet</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-06-05 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 5, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>Every good Web 2.0 website needs a bookmarklet or three, right? 43V now has a Tools page where I've added a handy bookmarklet that allows you to highlight an on-screen scripture reference and look it up on 43V.

I don't consider myself a backwards hick, but I do have some decent opinions about some touchy subjects, some of which may come up from time to time. I don't apologize.
I had a blog in the past that served primarily as my outlet for geeky stuff (just as this one is). Occasionally, I'd throw in something about my faith as a Christian and it would invariably tick off someone and I'd get nasty comments.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/43-verses-and-1-more-blog/>43 Verses and 1 More Blog</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2006-06-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jun 2, 2006</time></div></div><div class=summary>I launched my most recent pet project: 43 Verses.
The idea is simple… I needed a place to list all those darned bible verses I'm supposed to be remembering. Well, turns out I have a horible memory when it comes to this stuff, so why not make another Web app to do the work for me?
Less than a day after the launch of 43V, I got an email from a long-time blog reader offering to host the thing on his reseller account (thanks again, Mike).</div></section><div class=pagination><span class=prev><a href=/page/10/><span class=arrow>←</span> Newer posts</a></span></div></div></main><footer id=footer><div class=copyright>© Copyright
