My name is Tim. I like to create stuff.
You can follow me on the birdsite. Indeed, I have left Twitter at least once, but for now, I&amp;rsquo;m back. :-) In the day I work for a company called Planning Center, which builds really great software for churches. At night and on weekends I like to tinker with things that bend my mind, such as compilers and algorithm challenges.</description></item><item><title>Using a Raspberry Pi as a Planning Center Check-Ins Printer Station</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/using-a-raspberry-pi-as-a-planning-center-check-ins-printer-station/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 16:20:30 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/using-a-raspberry-pi-as-a-planning-center-check-ins-printer-station/</guid><description>First, some background ðŸ”—My church uses Planning Center Check-Ins to track attendance for churchgoers, and to help with security with little ones going to kids areas. It&amp;rsquo;s a great product. Yay!
Check-Ins runs on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows machines. Yay!
Dymo label printers are cheap and plentiful. Yay!
Check-Ins can print to a Dymo printer from macOS or Windows, but not from a tablet. Boo!
The problem ðŸ”—We want to print to Dymo printers, which are inexpensive, from an iPad.</description></item><item><title>I Built a Lisp Compiler</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/i-built-a-lisp-compiler/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 21:10:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/i-built-a-lisp-compiler/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m very proud to announce the completion of my first programming language compiler!

My Twitter account was 10 years old, and the anniversary, as anniversaries often do, prompted me to think about the value of a decade spent microblogging.
I remember when Twitter was a quiet site for geeks, and my first tweets were about HTTP servers and Git and SliceHost (remember them?). And my geek friends replied sometimes. And there were no politics.</description></item><item><title>Dymo Printer Agent for Linux</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/dymo-printer-agent/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2018 21:55:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/dymo-printer-agent/</guid><description>Note: We no longer use this. I have an updated post for the new setup.
Our church uses iPads and Dymo printers for children check-in. Parents check in their child, a label prints on the printer, and they stick the label on the child&amp;rsquo;s shirt. We use Planning Center Check-ins of course, and it&amp;rsquo;s great!
One downside to Dymo printers, however, is that their software only runs on Mac and Windows, necessitating a full computer connected to the printer.</description></item><item><title>Authority on Rails (Gem for Declaring User Authorization)</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/authority-on-rails-gem-for-declaring-user-authorization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/authority-on-rails-gem-for-declaring-user-authorization/</guid><description>CanCan is a wonderful plugin for Rails that allows you to define all your authorization logic in one place.

First, a review of what default_scope does:
The first call to Person.all applies the default scope and adds a where clause that returns only non-deleted folks.</description></item><item><title>Use rsync instead of cp</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/use-rsync-instead-of-cp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 May 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/use-rsync-instead-of-cp/</guid><description>I tend to use rsync when others would typically use a simple cp for copying files. A few reasons:
It can be canceled in the middle, and resumed later. It can show a progress bar that (while not perfect) is great for large files or lots of files.

Almost every one has a screen or two somewhere that shows a listing, and at the bottom it has pagination links, e.g. next page, page 3, etc. For a recent app I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on, the interface is very search-driven, i.e. the user enters some criteria the results are displayed.
As an experiment, I left off the pagination links. In this app, there is no &amp;ldquo;next page.</description></item><item><title>SliceHost Affiliate Link</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/slicehost-affiliate-link/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/slicehost-affiliate-link/</guid><description>Just posting this for any friends getting ready to sign up for a SliceHost account.

git branch tells you which branch you&amp;rsquo;re on.
git branch -a lists all branches, even remote ones.
git checkout mybranch checks out the branch you want.
git checkout -b newbranch creates a new branch from the one you&amp;rsquo;re on, and checks it out for you.
git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git merge mybranch merges changes from one branch to your master branch.</description></item><item><title>Git For People Who Know Svn (Things I've Learned, Part 1)</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/git-for-people-who-know-svn-things-ive-learne/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/git-for-people-who-know-svn-things-ive-learne/</guid><description>First, the mental hurdles:You don&amp;rsquo;t need a server to have a git repository. All your commit history is available locally and quickly, with simple commands. Same with branches and tags. Git &amp;ldquo;checkout&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;commit&amp;rdquo; are commands you run locally. Svn &amp;ldquo;checkout&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;commit&amp;rdquo; are really more like &amp;ldquo;pull&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;push&amp;rdquo; with git.
Now, the commands:
rails myapp &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd myapp &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git init &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git add . &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git commit -a creates a repo and makes the first commit (but still nothing is sent to any server; all work is done locally in your own repository)</description></item><item><title>Advanced Ruby on Rails</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/advanced-ruby-on-rails/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/advanced-ruby-on-rails/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading the book Advanced Rails by Brad Ediger.

ZiddlyWiki was a product I built and maintained for awhile.</description></item><item><title>Mac Bragging</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/mac-bragging/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/mac-bragging/</guid><description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually done anything with the new Mac, but I&amp;rsquo;ve sure had fun doing it! I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit swamped with work lately, so my bandwidth for additional projects is near zero. I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to install all the geeky Mac tools and surf the web a lot.
Oh, and I worked last night to get all my photos (over 30GB worth!) in one place (on the Mac) so I can start sorting and archiving and such.</description></item><item><title>New Mac</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/new-mac/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/new-mac/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post from my brand spanking new MacBook Pro. Man O Man is this thing a piece of work. It&amp;rsquo;s simply beautiful. It feels solid, yet lightweight. It&amp;rsquo;s screen is absolutely flawless and can be seen surprizingly well from all angles. The keyboard illumination feature is kick-butt. Typing at night will never be the same (yes I know how to type, but doing programming requires a lot of arrow keys and symbols, and I can&amp;rsquo;t always find those in the dark).</description></item><item><title>Switchers</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/switchers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/switchers/</guid><description>Seems everybody who&amp;rsquo;s anybody these days is &amp;ldquo;switching&amp;rdquo; from one platform to another. Mark Pilgrim switched from Mac to Linux. Jamie Zawinski switched from Linux to Mac. Josh Marshall switched from Windows to Mac. And, well, I can&amp;rsquo;t think of anyone prominent who switched to Windows, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure everybody&amp;rsquo;s drooling over Vista.
My point is, over the last two years, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt less and less like a &amp;ldquo;switcher&amp;rdquo; and more like a tool collector.</description></item><item><title>Stephen and Tim Day</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/stephen-and-tim-day/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/stephen-and-tim-day/</guid><description>Today was officially proclaimed "Stephen and Tim day" because of all our work lately on integrating our systems with the state of Oklahoma.</description></item><item><title>The Team</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/the-team-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/the-team-3/</guid><description>My coworker Joseph put this together.

I got an iPod for my birthday two months ago. And I love(d) it. I&amp;rsquo;ve become addicted to a handful of podcasts over the past few months and my collection of music has been slowly growing. My car radio has largely forgotten the sound of traditional broadcast radio.Yesterday, my iPod booted up with this icon. I took it back to Best Buy to get it exchanged, only to find out the extra fifty bucks spent on &amp;ldquo;extended service&amp;rdquo; or whatever they called it means they ship the iPod back to Apple for repair instead of making me do it.</description></item><item><title>Junk Email Filter Dot Com</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/junk-email-filter-dot-com/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/junk-email-filter-dot-com/</guid><description>We just started using an email filtering service at Cedar Ridge. So far, I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased with it. In the two days it&amp;rsquo;s been in place, only a handful of spam messages have passed through to our server, and every one of those were filtered by our existing DNS blacklist filtering.
The filter works by proxy, meaning all mail destined for our domain is first delivered to junkemailfilter.com. Their server filters out the spam using some fancy voodoo and delivers the good stuff to our server.</description></item><item><title>Less Spam</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/less-spam/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/less-spam/</guid><description>I have an ongoing experiment in which I never empty my Spam folder in Gmail. On the left side of the screen, when I log in, I can see how many spam messages I have. Gmail automatically deletes spam messages over thirty days old, so this is an accurate representation of how many spam messages I get in a given thirty-day period.When I first started using Gmail, my spam folder grew quickly to contain over five hundred spam messages!</description></item><item><title>Python Rehab Clinic, Part I</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/python-rehab-clinic-part-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/python-rehab-clinic-part-i/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many people are switching from Python to Ruby these days, but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a bit and thought it would be helpful to a few people if I cross-referenced my Python knowledge to my (growing) Ruby knowledge. I got this idea from James on the OK.rb mailing list.
Part One will focus on where to find what in the Ruby community. With any programming language or framework, you have a set of resources you go to often to find what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.</description></item><item><title>What's the Diff?</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/whats-the-diff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/whats-the-diff/</guid><description>Interesting campaign, but surely they're not implying the BSOD only happens on non-pirated Windows software, are they?Speaking of BSOD, how did I ever miss this?

This required a major overhaul of the code, but now that it's done (bar a few remaining bugs I'm sure), it should be much easier to add other translations later (as they are made available as web services).
I'm still tweaking the UI for working with the translations, so bare with me. Suggestions are welcome.

Just go to your 43V &amp;quot;My Verses&amp;quot; page and add this to the URL: &amp;quot;?format=js&amp;quot;. If you don't want all your verses listed, you can add another argument called &amp;quot;count&amp;quot; like this: &amp;quot;&amp;amp;count=10&amp;quot;. So the full URL might look like this: http://43verses.com/users/show/1?format=js&amp;amp;count=10You can see an example of this in use at our family weblog.</description></item><item><title>KJV, ASV, YLT, AKJV</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/kjv-asv-ylt-akjv/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/kjv-asv-ylt-akjv/</guid><description>There's a web service API for these older translations (all in the public domain). I'm thinking about adding them to 43V. I get chills just imagining the list of available translations growing as more translations are made available as web services. Of course, the big kahuna would be NIV, but I doubt Zondervan would ever make their content freely available. Pay per word, maybe, but never free.

I had a blog in the past that served primarily as my outlet for geeky stuff (just as this one is). Occasionally, I'd throw in something about my faith as a Christian and it would invariably tick off someone and I'd get nasty comments.</description></item><item><title>43 Verses and 1 More Blog</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/43-verses-and-1-more-blog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/43-verses-and-1-more-blog/</guid><description>I launched my most recent pet project: 43 Verses.
The idea is simple&amp;hellip; I needed a place to list all those darned bible verses I'm supposed to be remembering. Well, turns out I have a horible memory when it comes to this stuff, so why not make another Web app to do the work for me?
