I'm writing this post from my brand spanking new MacBook Pro. Man O Man is this thing a piece of work. It's simply beautiful. It feels solid, yet lightweight. It's screen is absolutely flawless and can be seen surprizingly well from all angles. The keyboard illumination feature is kick-butt. Typing at night will never be the same (yes I know how to type, but doing programming requires a lot of arrow keys and symbols, and I can't always find those in the dark).

My additional RAM is in the mail and should arrive tomorrow. I have to say though, I'm running this thing with only 512MB of RAM right now and it still feels pretty darn snappy. I can't wait to see what it will do with 2GB.
