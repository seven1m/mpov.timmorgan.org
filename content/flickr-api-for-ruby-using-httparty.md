<p>Continuing with my HTTParty, I've created a fairly simple Flickr API wrapper for Ruby: <a href="http://github.com/seven1m/flickr_party">flickr_party</a>. This one was a bit more difficult than the <a href="http://github.com/seven1m/campaign_monitor_party">Campaign Monitor one</a>, but still fun nonetheless.</p><p>Why reinvent the wheel?</p><ol><li>It's fun.</li><li>I always learn something.<br /> <ul><li>Sometimes I learn to not reinvent the wheel.</li><li>But sometimes I learn so much more.</li></ul></li><li> The libraries out there I spent 10 minutes looking at didn't seem to fully support application authentication. Yes, I'm sure I'm wrong, and they all support it just fine. Or maybe I was just looking at the wrong ones. But in any event, I took this as the opportunity to build something cool (see item #1 above).</li></ol>
