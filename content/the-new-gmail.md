It seems the Gmail team has quietly slipped in a minor upgrade to the revolutionary and still yet after more than 3 years, best web email system I've ever seen. I have to use Outlook at work and yearn for the day that it will properly thread replies as Gmail does, but I digress...

Anyway, is it just me, or is the slightly "improved" Gmail actually dumber? Here are some pet peeves I've aquired in the last week of using the new Gmail:<ol>	<li>For one, the drop down menus (you know, for selecting an action on individual and/or selected email) are no longer real select lists; they're instead some DHTML kind of thing that has a scroll bar that feels flimsy. When I use the scroll wheel on my mouse, the whole page scrolls. It's just weird.</li>	<li>It crashes Firefox. Every. Time.</li>	<li>When navigating away from Gmail, it always asks me if I am sure because I may lose data. What? Just let me go already!</li>	<li>Dangit, I don't want chat mixed with my email client! Stop turning that thing back on. When I log in for two seconds to check my email, I don't want some long lost friend [I've been avoiding] starting up a chat with me.</li>	<li>This is sort of a meta-peeve. Since I dislike the new version so much, I clicked "Old Version" in the upper-right. But that setting isn't saved from browser to browser from session to session. I keep having to click it to go back to the old version.</li></ol>No doubt, Google will be removing the old version, but only if a majority of the users are happy with the new one. Let your hatred be known by switching to the old version with me.

On a upbeat note, I do like that my Gmail quota has doubled to nearly 5GB. Not that I will ever use that much -- I just like knowing that I will never use more than like 15%. :-)
