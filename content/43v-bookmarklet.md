Every good Web 2.0 website needs a bookmarklet or three, right?  43V now has a <a href="http://43verses.com/about/tools" target="_blank">Tools page</a> where I&#39;ve added a handy bookmarklet that allows you to highlight an on-screen scripture reference and look it up on 43V. Super handy for all those Verse-of-the-day emails you&#39;ve been getting for the past three years.
