I wanted to forewarn any readers that this blog is not necessarily politically correct all the time. I don&#39;t consider myself a backwards hick, but I do have some decent opinions about some touchy subjects, some of which may come up from time to time. I don&#39;t apologize.

I had a blog in the past that served primarily as my outlet for geeky stuff (just as this one is). Occasionally, I&#39;d throw in something about my faith as a Christian and it would invariably tick off someone and I&#39;d get nasty comments. People would ask me to stick to the tech stuff and so on. Well, forget it.

So there you go.&quot;MPOV&quot; is sort of an antithesis of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view">Wikipedia Neutral Point of View (NPOV) policy</a>, which mandates that all articles be free from slant. MPOV stands for My Point of View.

Update: I just found this definition for <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Megalomaniacal_point_of_view">MPOV</a>. Interesting. Probably not far from the truth. :-)
