It's official: I'm a sucker.

I got an iPod for my birthday two months ago. And I love(d) it. I've become addicted to a handful of podcasts over the past few months and my collection of music has been slowly growing. My car radio has largely forgotten the sound of traditional broadcast radio.<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Media_httpstaticflick_utfcc" height="46" src="/images/media_httpstaticflick_utfCc.gif.scaled500.gif" width="42" /></div>Yesterday, my iPod booted up with this icon. I took it back to Best Buy to get it exchanged, only to find out the extra fifty bucks spent on "extended service" or whatever they called it means <i>they </i>ship the iPod back to Apple for repair instead of making me do it. Whoopti-freaking-do. No exchange, no loaner. Three weeks without my beloved MP3 player.

Secondly, two months then it breaks!? What's up with that? This can't be typical. I hope not. Especially if I only get to enjoy music and podcasts for a couple months at a time with three-week intermissions.<i>Update:</i> After two and a half weeks, I called Best Buy to get an update. Their response: <i>oh yeah, we were supposed to call you; you can come get a new iPod now. </i>That's weird.
