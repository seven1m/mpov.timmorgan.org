I still plan on writing the final part in the Git series on this blog, but in the meantime, on a related note, we now have a page up on the OneBody wiki about <a href="http://beonebody.org/trac/wiki/UsingGit">Using Git</a>. It includes some instructions for using Git on Windows and some other commands that may be helpful to noobs.
