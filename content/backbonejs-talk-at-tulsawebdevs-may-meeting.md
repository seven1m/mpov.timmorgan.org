<p>Hey friends, I wanted to let you know I will be giving a presentation on <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/" target="_blank">Backbone.js</a> at the next <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=199713962534" target="_blank">TulsaWebDevs</a> meet-up.</p><p /><div>For any of you using more than the tiniest amount of JavaScript in your web-based applications, Backbone.js may be something to consider. Backbone brings structure and organization to the client-side that we've long had in MVC frameworks on the server. Here are some benefits:</div><div><ul><li>Stores data in specialized data "models" instead of directly on the DOM.</li><li>"Views" give you good separation of presentation from the data layer.</li><li>"Controllers" map url hash fragments to discreet actions.</li><li>Very lightweight, less than 10kb.</li><li>Doesn't assume much about your UI or your backend data store.</li></ul><div>I'll be walking through a sample app and demonstrating use with Rails as a backend (or you can be easily use the server framework of your choice). I'll also give an overview of <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/">Underscore.js</a>, a related product of the guys at <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/">DocumentCloud</a>, used within Backbone.</div></div><p /><div>You do not have to be a JavaScript whiz kid to need something like Backbone. If your last bit of JavaScript reminded you of a dish from Spaghetti Warehouse, then Backbone may be for you!</div><p /><div>TulsaWebDevs next meeting will be on Monday, May 9th&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href="http://tulsacollab.com/" target="_blank">Tulsa Collaboratorium</a>&nbsp;at 6pm. Hope to see you there!</div><p /><div><strong>Update: </strong>The meeting was awesome last night -- our largest meeting to date -- 14 people! Surprisingly, I think most people enjoyed my presentation and incoherent rambling.</div><p /><div>You can view the <a href="http://github.com/seven1m/crk">source code for Crk</a>&nbsp;and my <a href="https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=ddrk4r9k_132c5jpzrdj">Backbone.js slides</a>.</div>
