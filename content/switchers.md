Seems everybody who's anybody these days is "switching" from one platform to another. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pilgrim">Mark Pilgrim</a> switched from <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks">Mac to Linux</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jwz">Jamie Zawinski</a> switched from <a href="http://jwz.livejournal.com/494040.html">Linux to Mac</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Marshall">Josh Marshall</a> switched from <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/007827.php">Windows to Mac</a>. And, well, I can't think of anyone prominent who switched to Windows, but I'm sure everybody's drooling over Vista.

My point is, over the last two years, I've felt less and less like a "switcher" and more like a tool collector. I think of people like my dad... people who never throw anything away and collect every obscure tool they can get their hands on. My dad had a tool for everything. And he would always know which tool would do the job best in any given situation. I'd like to think I'm similar in a more geeky sense.

I've been using Ubuntu at home for nearly two years. It serves me well in most of my tasks.

I use Windows at work. It serves me well in most of my tasks. Being in an all-Microsoft environment, Windows really shines.

Today I bought a MacBook Pro for my personal use. I'm not "switching" -- in fact, I hope to install Linux and maybe even Windows on the one machine. Why? Because all three are good. And because Apple hardware is awesome. Apple made a very smart move in changing to the Intel processor.

So the Mac will arrive in four days or so... I'll let you know how it goes.
