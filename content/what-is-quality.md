A lightning talk (5-minute) presentation I gave at [TulsaWebDevs](http://tulsawebdevs.org/):

[What is Quality](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1__YqyRhtMws8AwS3OAKXt1CUWKo1QEr1R8YUqrn9IN0/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

Note: I used to have this presentation embedded here, but it was scrolling the page and interfering, so now it's just a link.
