**Hi!** ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tim. I like to create stuff.

- You can [follow me on the birdsite](https://twitter.com/timmrgn). Indeed, I have left Twitter [at least once](/leaving-twitter/), but for now, I'm back. :-)
- In the day I work for a company called [Planning Center](https://planningcenter.com), which builds really great software for churches.
- At night and on weekends I like to tinker with things that bend my mind, such as [compilers](/i-built-a-lisp-compiler/) and algorithm challenges.
- I often do volunteer tech work for my church, so this blog might talk about the [intersection of technology and church life](/using-a-raspberry-pi-as-a-planning-center-check-ins-printer-station).
- I like to record videos on YouTube [of my coding sessions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgWip0vxtqu34rZrFeCpUow).
- I have a few other sites that I have created, some of which may still be around in the year you are reading this:
  1. [timmorgan.org](https://timmorgan.org/)
  1. [timmorgan.dev](https://timmorgan.dev/)
  1. [tilde.town/~seven1m](https://tilde.town/~seven1m)
  1. [seven1m.sdf.org](http://seven1m.sdf.org/)
