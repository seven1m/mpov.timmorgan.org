Just saw this in my referrer logs... You can search on Google for all occurrences *except* in a certain site.

Many know about adding `site:timmorgan.org` or similar to only search within a certain domain. Well, maybe it was obvious, but now I know you can do `-site:timmorgan.org` to search everywhere *but* that domain. Nice.
