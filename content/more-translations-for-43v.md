43 Verses now offers six translations instead of just one! This required a major overhaul of the code, but now that it&#39;s done (bar a few remaining bugs I&#39;m sure), it should be much easier to add other translations later (as they are made available as web services).

I&#39;m still tweaking the UI for working with the translations, so bare with me. Suggestions are welcome.

Later.
