<a href="http://43verses.com">43 Verses</a> now offers a few of the verse lists (the recent page and individual users&#39; pages) as feeds so you can keep up with the goings-on from your favorite news reader. I&#39;ve been using the <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> lately, and I&#39;m starting to like it a lot. Even just the ability to <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/user/00467140441547616699/state/com.google/starred">star</a> items to find them easily later is a very handy feature.
