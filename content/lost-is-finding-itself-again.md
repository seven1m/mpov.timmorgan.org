My guess is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_%28tv_show%29">Lost</a> has lost many of its viewers in the last year due to a crawling storyline and endless questions without answers. I say this because, after watching tonight's episode, the direction of the show has definitely changed. I think those writers finally figured out they don't have blind followers -- they have to get off their butts and actually move the story along. And that's what they finally did tonight. Thank you. Now I can look forward to Wednesday nights again.
