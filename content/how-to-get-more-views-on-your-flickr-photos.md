I uploaded some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timothymorgan/259838176/">crappy</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timothymorgan/259268110/in/photostream/">photos</a> from our breastfeeding class two weeks ago; one has six times more views and other has over 25 times more views than all my other crappy photos. Just goes to show that for most people, <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5430343841227974645">the Internet is for porn</a>.
