Oh Good Lord in heaven, forgive me: <b>I&#39;ve started a new blog.</b><p /><div><div>Many of you know I&#39;ve long had a passion for churches and the software they use. I have plans to challenge the notion of <a href="http://church.io/better-church-software" target="_blank">what good church software should be doing</a>. I have ideas for making better tools to aid management, shepherding and engagement.</div> <p /><div>I want desperately to sit down and just start hacking on a new product, but the older and wiser part of me (I <i>did</i> just turn 30 this year, you know) understands that I should have a plan, or at least, you know, a clue about what I&#39;m going to do.</div> </div><p /><div>I hope to make the blog a place where I publicly share my ideas and opinions and get my assumptions tested a bit. I don&#39;t pretend to know everything about making great church software, but I like to think I am in a unique position, being both a long-time, committed volunteer in a strong church, a decent engineer, and a geek who can communicate (maybe :-).</div> <p /><div>So, lacking further ado, I present to you: <a href="http://Church.

IO" target="_blank">Church.

IO</a></div><p /><div>If you&#39;re a church volunteer, minister, or geek, please stay tuned and let me know your thoughts. And subscribe!</div>
