I gave a talk tonight at the quarterly Oklahoma Ruby User Group meeting in Edmond. It was not nearly as difficult nor as boring (for everybody else) as I had feared. In fact, I think many in the room actually <i>enjoyed</i> my talk!Most of it focused on my experiences getting Rails to work on Microsoft IIS. <a href="http://seven1m.com/rails_on_iis.ppt">Here is my presentation</a>. And here is my <a href="http://timothymorgan.tadalist.com/lists/public/323610">Ten Rails Tips of a Ruby Noobie</a>, which I also shared.
