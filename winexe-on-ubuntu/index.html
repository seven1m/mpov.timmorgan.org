Winexe doesn't have a Debian package that I'm aware of, and getting documentation on how to make it compile is spotty at best. The <a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/winexe/ target=_blank>official SF page</a> might be the obvious destination to find out how to get it, but alas, it no workie.</div><p><div>Fortunately, the peeps at <a href=http://zenoss.org target=_blank>Zenoss</a> got your back. Here's the scoop:</div><p><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/843062.js?file=build_winexe.sh"></script></div><p><div>(The patch is necessary to fix a tiny typo in winexe/service.c &ndash; if it doesn't apply properly, chances are good the typo has been fixed since this blog post.)</div><p><div>Once you've compiled, now for some fun!</div><p><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/843062.js?file=winexe_example.sh"></script></div><p><div>Never again must you VNC into a Windows box just to restart a service! I even have a script that remotely executes a "git pull" and then restarts all the relevant Windows services.
