The red dots repesent people who believe they&rsquo;re better than everyone else and cut in line.</p><p>I see this happen every day. I will be nearly at the end of the line, watching cars turn down the side road. It&rsquo;s become somewhat of an obsession (one that only serves to make me angry every time I indulge it) for me to make a mental note of these heathen people&rsquo;s cars and watch as they pull in 50 car lengths ahead of me moments later.</p><p>What do you think?
