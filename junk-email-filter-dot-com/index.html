The cool thing is that the junk mail never touches our server, so the server load is lightened considerably. I&rsquo;d guess our mail server will be doing about 25% of the work it used to. That saves us bandwidth, processor load, and generally makes our staff much happier.</p></div></section></main><footer id=footer><div class=copyright>© Copyright
