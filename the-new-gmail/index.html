Here are some pet peeves I&rsquo;ve aquired in the last week of using the new Gmail:<ol><li>For one, the drop down menus (you know, for selecting an action on individual and/or selected email) are no longer real select lists; they&rsquo;re instead some DHTML kind of thing that has a scroll bar that feels flimsy. When I use the scroll wheel on my mouse, the whole page scrolls. It&rsquo;s just weird.</li><li>It crashes Firefox. Every. Time.</li><li>When navigating away from Gmail, it always asks me if I am sure because I may lose data. What? Just let me go already!</li><li>Dangit, I don&rsquo;t want chat mixed with my email client! Stop turning that thing back on. When I log in for two seconds to check my email, I don&rsquo;t want some long lost friend [I&rsquo;ve been avoiding] starting up a chat with me.</li><li>This is sort of a meta-peeve. Since I dislike the new version so much, I clicked &ldquo;Old Version&rdquo; in the upper-right. But that setting isn&rsquo;t saved from browser to browser from session to session. I keep having to click it to go back to the old version.</li></ol>No doubt, Google will be removing the old version, but only if a majority of the users are happy with the new one. Let your hatred be known by switching to the old version with me.</p><p>On a upbeat note, I do like that my Gmail quota has doubled to nearly 5GB. Not that I will ever use that much &ndash; I just like knowing that I will never use more than like 15%. :-)</p></div></section></main><footer id=footer><div class=copyright>© Copyright
