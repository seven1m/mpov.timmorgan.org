I&rsquo;m not sure, but it seems to be a caching issue on the WP API and not so much the script&rsquo;s fault.</i><i><b>Update 2:</b> The load on my server was too much, so I removed the hosted script from my server. You can still download the source and host it yourself.</i><i><b>Update 3:</b> Turns out it&rsquo;s better to just subscribe to each page&rsquo;s feed rather than to use a script like this.</i>Back before Wikipedia had <a href=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/API>an API</a>, I created <a href=http://mpov.wordpress.com/2006/08/23/wikipedia-watchlist-rss-feed/>a script</a> that scraped the HTML and generated a plain RSS feed of my watchlist. Now, it&rsquo;s even easier as the new API does most of the work for you, provided you correctly authenticate with it. So, version 2 of the script is much simpler, and simply acts to authenticate a user and grab the feed as-is and hand it to the browser/aggregator/etc.</p><p>The script source is <a href=http://timmorgan.org/code/watchlist.txt>here</a>.</p><p>Basically, the URL would look like this:<blockquote class=posterous_short_quote><a href="http://71m.org/watchlist.cgi?username=USERNAME&password=PASSWORD"><a href="http://71m.org/watchlist.cgi?username=USERNAME&amp;amp;password=PASSWORD" target=_blank rel=noopener>http://71m.org/watchlist.cgi?username=USERNAME&password=PASSWORD</a></a></blockquote>Before you go trying it on my server, be aware that: (I have removed the script from my server. Sorry.)<ol><li>Your password and username are in the URL in plain-text (and thus in my server logs if you use this script directly from my server). This might scare you. I&rsquo;m not an evil person, but then again, I wouldn&rsquo;t believe someone else telling me that for a second. If you don&rsquo;t trust me, then grab the script and stick it on your own server.</li><li>I will leave my script running for you to use directly, but if the load becomes too much on my lowly server, I will disable it.</li></ol>So, there&rsquo;s two reasons to grab the script and run it on your own server.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=http://jyotirmoy.net/code.html#wikiwatch>Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya</a> for his Python script that does basically the same thing.</p></div></section></main><footer id=footer><div class=copyright>© Copyright
