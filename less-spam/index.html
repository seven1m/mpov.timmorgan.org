But over the last several months, my spam count has slowly dwindled to 150.</p><p>Why? I can&rsquo;t pinpoint the reason other than maybe spammers are concluding it&rsquo;s less effective than it used to be. I mean, just about everybody heavily filters their email these days; the liklihood of a spam message getting through to most inboxes is dismal I think. Is this the beginning of the end? Have we reached and passed the spike in spam history?Not that I think spam will ever completely go away, but it&rsquo;s possible it&rsquo;s declining a bit and will level off at some bearable point.</p><p>What about you? Have you noticed less or more spam in your email?<em>Update 08/02/2006:</em> My spam count has grown to nearly 250 over the last month and a half. I guess it was a fluke.<em>Update 12/12/2006:</em> My spam count is now over 1000! So much for my less spam theory.<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt=Media_httpstaticflick_jjtia height=61 src=/images/media_httpstaticflick_jJtia.gif.scaled500.gif width=132></div></p></div></section></main><footer id=footer><div class=copyright>© Copyright
