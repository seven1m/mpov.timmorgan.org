Oops. That got me thinking&mldr; these watchlists should have feeds so I don&rsquo;t have to keep pulling up my bookmarks every day.</p><p>Now, until they actually add feeds to those pages, I have my own solution in a few lines of Ruby code: WatchlistRSS.zip This code can be run as a CGI on a web server and generates feeds like this.</p><p>So, I&rsquo;m sharing this because the other two or three scripts out there written to do this suck IMO. (Or at least I couldn&rsquo;t get them to work &ndash; which in that case means I suck :-)</p></div></section></main><footer id=footer><div class=copyright>© Copyright
