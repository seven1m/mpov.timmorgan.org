Back in 2005, I uploaded a bunch of [crude little pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/timothymorgan/sets/1615269/) to my Flickr account and called them my "Whiteboard Icons" set. Hundreds of people have, over the years, found them to be useful on their blogs, flowcharts, and more.

Today, I finally added a couple new icons to the set ([1](http://www.flickr.com/photos/timothymorgan/4420821913/in/set-1615269/), [2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/timothymorgan/4421587950/in/set-1615269/)). Only took me five years.

Enjoy.

**Update:** Various sizes and scalable versions are available in the [whiteboard_icons git repository](https://github.com/seven1m/whiteboard_icons).
