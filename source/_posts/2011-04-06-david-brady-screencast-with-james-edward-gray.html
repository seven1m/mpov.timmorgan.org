Just got done watching this excellent discussion of Ruby hashes, associative arrays, testing, and Ruby culture.<p /><div><a href="http://www.heartmindcode.com/blog/2011/04/james-edward-gray-associative-arrays-and-ruby-hashes/">Link.</a></div> <p /><div>James is an excellent force of enlightenment and encouragement in our little community, and I&#39;m proud that he&#39;s also an Okie. Go watch this video.</div>
