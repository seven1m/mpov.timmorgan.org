Long title, I know. Here's how I did it...<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>sudo apt-get install fetchmail postfixcdnano -w .fetchmailrc</pre></div></div>Add the following to the file (replacing everything in CAPS appropriately):<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>poll pop.gmail.com with proto POP3 and options no dnsuser 'YOUR_GMAIL_ADDRESS' there with password 'YOUR_PASSWORD' is \'YOUR_UBUNTU_USERNAME' here options ssl</pre></div></div>Now:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>chmod 710 .fetchmailrcsudo nano -w /etc/crontab</pre></div></div>Add the following to your crontab file:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>10 7 * * 1 YOUR_UBUNTU_USERNAME fetchmail -k</pre></div></div>This will run fetchmail every Sunday and grab your email. It seems either fetchmail or gmail limits each connect to something around 400-500 messages, so to get started, you can run "fetchmail -k" a few dozen times to download all your mail, then let crontab do the rest on a weekly basis.Your mail is downloaded to a single mbox file in /var/spool/mail/YOUR_UBUNTU_USERNAME. Being a single file makes it nice for backing up, moving, etc. I hear Thunderbird can easily read the file, and I think Apple Mail.app can as well.Just makes you feel good having all your mail backed up, now doesn't it?
