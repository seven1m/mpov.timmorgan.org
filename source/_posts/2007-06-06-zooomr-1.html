<a href="http://zooomr.com">Zooomr</a> is a little photo sharing site that has a wee bit of potential I think. While I wouldn't exactly call it "reliable" at the moment (its recent upgrade took it down for weeks and it's service has been sketchy ever since), I could see it amassing a cult following among geeks like myself.I'm still waiting on an API key so I can test my Flickr migration script. I wrote a bit of Ruby to download each of my Flickr photos, along with their tags, geotags, description, title, etc. and upload them one by one to Zooomr. I'm anxious to see if it works.At the very least, I think it will be neat to have my photos in two places on the Web.
