I don't know how many people are switching from Python to Ruby these days, but I've learned a bit and thought it would be helpful to a few people if I cross-referenced my Python knowledge to my (growing) Ruby knowledge. I got this idea from James [on the OK.rb mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/okrb/browse_thread/thread/74dd13bb7c00aa75/ee6623c74c010d77#ee6623c74c010d77).

Part One will focus on where to find what in the Ruby community. With any programming language or framework, you have a set of resources you go to often to find what you're looking for. I had a list of Python-related bookmarks I frequented; now I have a list of bookmarks for Ruby stuff.

One disclaimer: this is *not* a comprehensive list or comparison. It is just a representation of *my* Python world cross-referenced with *my* Ruby world.
