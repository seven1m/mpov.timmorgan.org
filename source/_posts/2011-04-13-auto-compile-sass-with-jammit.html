<i>I won&#39;t bother explaining to my regular readers what these two things are. If you need this, then you know... ;-)</i><p /><div><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/918402">https://gist.github.com/918402</a></p></div> <p /><div>I know that both SASS and Compass can be setup to &quot;watch&quot; a directory and auto-compile when files are changed, but it seemed a waste to me to have another thing I have to remember to launch.</div> <p /><div>This hack piggybacks on Jammit&#39;s include_stylesheets helper method and compiles and .scss files in the public/stylesheets directory if they&#39;ve changed since last time.</div> <p /><div>I hope this helps someone.</div>
