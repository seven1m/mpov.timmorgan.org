My 1st generation Macbook Pro is starting to show its age, but tonight I used my birthday money in an effort at rejuvenation.<p />First, a new Seagate hard drive. 500gb, 7200rpm, $99 at Best Buy. It took about an hour to get my machine apart, with all its tiny screws, get the new drive in, and put it back together.<p /> Next, I said good-bye to Mac OS X. I installed the brand new Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, and man it screams on this machine. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s Linux, the new drive, or a combination. This machine has new life!<p /> Some pictures of the operation are below:<b><br /></b> <p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><a href="/images/img_0310.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0310" height="375" src="/images/img_0310.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" /></a><a href="/images/img_0312.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0312" height="375" src="/images/img_0312.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" /></a><a href="/images/img_0313.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0313" height="375" src="/images/img_0313.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" /></a><a href="/images/img_0315.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0315" height="375" src="/images/img_0315.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" /></a></div></p>
