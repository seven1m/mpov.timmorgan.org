Just saw this in my referrer logs... You can search on Google for all occurrences <em>except</em> in a certain site.Many know about adding "site:timmorgan.org" or similar to only search within a certain domain. Well, maybe it was obvious, but now I know you can do "-site:timmorgan.org" to search everywhere <em>but</em> that domain. Nice.
