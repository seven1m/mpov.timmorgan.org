There&#39;s a web service API for these older translations (all in the public domain). I&#39;m thinking about adding them to 43V. I get chills just imagining the list of available translations growing as more translations are made available as web services. Of course, the big kahuna would be NIV, but I doubt Zondervan would ever make their content freely available. Pay per word, maybe, but never free. That&#39;s a shame.
