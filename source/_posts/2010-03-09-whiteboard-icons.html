Hundreds of people have, over the years, found them to be useful on their blogs, flowcharts, and more.<p /> Today, I finally added a couple new icons to the set (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timothymorgan/4420821913/in/set-1615269/" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timothymorgan/4421587950/in/set-1615269/" target="_blank">2</a>). Only took me five years.<p /> Enjoy.
