For Part 2 of our <a href="/2008/03/02/git-for-people-who-know-svn/">60-second Git tutorial</a>, we'll look at some super simple branching and merging.<code>git branch</code> tells you which branch you're on. <code>git branch -a</code> lists all branches, even remote ones.<code>git checkout mybranch</code> checks out the branch you want.<code>git checkout -b newbranch</code> creates a new branch from the one you're on, and checks it out for you.<code>git checkout master &amp;&amp; git merge mybranch</code> merges changes from one branch to your master branch. If you don't want to commit the changes, you can do <code>git merge --no-commit mybranch</code> instead.So far, we've only talked about local git usage. Isn't it cool that you can do so much without even having a server set up with our repo? I think so.Part 3 will include pulling and pushing your changes to remote repos.
