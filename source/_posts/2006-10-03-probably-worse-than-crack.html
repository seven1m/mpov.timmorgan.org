Not that I would really know, but I'd imagine hard drugs couldn't be much more addictive than Facebook. I'm still sinking my roots deep into that thing, finding more and more old friends and people I forgot about (sorry; bad memory :-).Particularly, I hope to find more college and high school friends and see what they're up to these days.
