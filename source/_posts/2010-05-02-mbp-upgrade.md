My 1st generation Macbook Pro is starting to show its age, but tonight I used my birthday money in an effort at rejuvenation.

First, a new Seagate hard drive. 500gb, 7200rpm, $99 at Best Buy. It took about an hour to get my machine apart, with all its tiny screws, get the new drive in, and put it back together.

Next, I said good-bye to Mac OS X. I installed the brand new Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, and man it screams on this machine. I'm not sure if it's Linux, the new drive, or a combination. This machine has new life!

Some pictures of the operation are below:
