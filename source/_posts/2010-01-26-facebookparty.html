<a href="http://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty"></a> I wanted to understand the Facebook REST API better, and decided I needed a simple wrapper for it. <a href="http://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty">HTTParty</a> to the rescue again!<p /><a href="http://github.com/seven1m/facebook_party">FacebookParty</a> (<a href="http://seven1m.github.com/facebook_party/">rdoc</a>) is along the same lines as my other _party style api wrappers. I can&#39;t take much credit for it though, since HTTParty is what makes this stuff so easy. Slap a pretty class on an api endpoint, and the rest is cake. And cake goes good with parties.<p /> <a href="http://gemcutter.org/gems/facebook_party"><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><a href="/images/fbparty.png"><img alt="Fbparty" height="169" src="/images/fbparty.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" /></a></div></a>
