I haven't actually <i>done</i> anything with the new Mac, but I've sure had fun doing it! I've been a bit swamped with work lately, so my bandwidth for additional projects is near zero. I've managed to install all the geeky Mac tools and surf the web a lot.Oh, and I worked last night to get all my photos (over 30GB worth!) in one place (on the Mac) so I can start sorting and archiving and such. I'd like to find some good DVDs and burn copies of all my photos and stick them somwhere safe (preferably different places). But with the recent hubbub about average lifespan of CD/DVD media, I'm a bit nervous. Need to do some research. I'll probably end up writing some DVDs and saving to an external HD, too, just for peace-of-mind.
