I launched my most recent pet project: <a href="http://43verses.com" target="_blank">43 Verses</a>. The idea is simple... I needed a place to list all those darned bible verses I&#39;m supposed to be remembering. Well, turns out I have a horible memory when it comes to this stuff, so why not make another Web app to do the work for me?Less than a day after the launch of 43V, I got an email from a long-time blog reader offering to host the thing on his reseller account (thanks again, Mike). Awesome! We&#39;re still working out some of the details, but looks like it&#39;s gonna happen soon.I&#39;ll write more about the tech of 43V in a later post... just wanted to get a quick post up here to record the current goings-on in my life. ...Oh, and to explain the purpose of this blog. Frankly, I don&#39;t care if anybody reads it. It&#39;s more for myself I suppose. I need an outlet for all these tech-related thoughts floating around in my head. My <a href="http://family.timmorgan.org" target="_blank">family blog</a> will remain for non-geek stuff.So here I go... polluting the blogosphere with one more set of bits.Later.
