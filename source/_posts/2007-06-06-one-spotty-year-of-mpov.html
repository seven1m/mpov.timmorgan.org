I just realized I've now had this blog for one year. While its postings have been sporadic at times, I'm happy to look back on what I've done tech-wise over the last year.FYI: Anyone who reads this blog may be interested to know that I can be found posting useless things all over teh Interwebs (not just here), many of which you can find at <a href="http://timmorgan.org">timmorgan.org</a> or on my brand new Jaiku account (<a href="http://timmorgan.jaiku.com/">timmorgan.jaiku.com</a>).
