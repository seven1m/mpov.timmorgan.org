Jeremy Ruston and Bob McElrath have taken over development of <a href="http://ziddlywiki.com">ZiddlyWiki</a>. This is amazing -- to see the community value something I worked on for a big chunk of my life and desire that it continue on without me. It's humbling and edifying at the same time! I wish them the best and hope they can take ZW places I never dreamed of.
