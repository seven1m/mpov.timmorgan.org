OneBody now has a real, bona fide <a href="http://onebodyapp.wordpress.com">blog of its own</a>. Thanks to WordPress.com, creating a new blog is waaaay too easy, evidenced by the fact that I now have 37 (just kidding).Our little project continues to grow and improve. I'm still waiting on that influx of talented, eager volunteers to make it awesome, though :-) For now, it will continue to be Tim's pet project, though I refuse to stop referring to the development "team" as "we" and "us."
