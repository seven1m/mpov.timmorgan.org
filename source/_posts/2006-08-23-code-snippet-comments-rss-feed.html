In my quest to make everything into a feed... I present the <a href="http://feed43.com/8055673348816228.xml">Code Snippet Comments feed</a>. It goes with <a href="http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/">this site</a>, which lacks a feed for comments posted on snippets.For this feed generation, I used a free service called <a href="http://feed43.com">Feed43</a>. It's quite powerful! Basically, you give it a URL and about ten minutes of your life working out some pattern recognition, and voila! you get a feed auto generated every six hours based on the content of the page.  Nice.
