I've been seeing a lot on the Web about this guy named Ron Paul. He's running for president in 2008, but first he has to get the Republican nomination. He has many supporters already, and I only see that growing over the next several months.

Ron Paul is the only politician I've read about who truly fights for individual rights and follows the constitution. He's restored my hope for the country and for the Republican party.
