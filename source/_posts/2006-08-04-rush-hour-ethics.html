On my way home every weekday, I pass South through these two intersections. During rush-hour, traffic can get quite backed up here, so the wait can easily be ten or fifteen minutes at this one point in my drive home.What's worse is that people cheat. As the second map below shows, people take a side road over to Peoria, turn South, then line up at the same intersection, but in a much shorter line. When their light turns green, they cut in front of all the people waiting patiently.

The red dots repesent people who believe they're better than everyone else and cut in line.I see this happen every day. I will be nearly at the end of the line, watching cars turn down the side road. It's become somewhat of an obsession (one that only serves to make me angry every time I indulge it) for me to make a mental note of these heathen people's cars and watch as they pull in 50 car lengths ahead of me  moments later.What do you think? Is it wrong to do this sort of thing?
