As we tend to do every couple years, Jennie and I have once again overhauled the website of <a href="http://cedarridgecc.com">Cedar Ridge Christian Church</a>, our church home in Broken Arrow, OK. I'm very proud of this one. It has a clean look but seems modern enough to <em>not</em> look like your run-of-the-mill church website.<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Media_httpmpovwordpresscomfiles200701crccthumbnailpng_ccvxjnzhyfxaeuo" height="109" src="/images/media_httpmpovwordpresscomfiles200701crccthumbnailpng_cCvxJnzHyFxaEuo.png.scaled500.png" width="128" /></div>
