<p><strong>Update: </strong>This was renamed to campaign_monitor_party.</p><p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><a href="/images/campaign_monitor_gem.png"><img alt="Campaign_monitor_gem" height="283" src="/images/campaign_monitor_gem.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" /></a></div></p><p>First of all, <a href="http://httparty.rubyforge.org">HTTParty</a> is simply amazing. That is all.<p />Second, Ruby never ceases to amaze me regarding its power and tools for meta-programming. "method_missing" is just too cool.<p /> Third, I created a 20-line wrapper class for the <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/">Campaign Monitor API</a> this weekend (using HTTParty). The code and the gem is over on GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/seven1m/campaign_monitor_party">http://github.com/seven1m/campaign_monitor_party</a>.</p>
