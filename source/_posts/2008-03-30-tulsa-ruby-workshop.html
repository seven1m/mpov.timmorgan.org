We're gearing up for the upcoming, very first <a href="http://tulsarubyworkshop.com">Tulsa Ruby Workshop</a>.<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Media_httpmpovwordpresscomfiles200803picture1thumbnailpng_affkbrinbcsagpv" height="111" src="/images/media_httpmpovwordpresscomfiles200803picture1thumbnailpng_AFFkbrInBCsAgpv.png.scaled500.png" width="128" /></div>Of course, all you need to know is on the <a href="http://tulsarubyworkshop.com">website</a>, but in short, it's a beginner's conference all about Ruby and Rails. If you're new to Ruby and/or Rails, this is for you (if you're in or near enough to Tulsa, Oklahoma that is). Tell everyone you know!
