For one reason: things just work. This is the first time I've ever installed a Linux OS and didn't have to crack open the terminal to tweak XOrg settings or to manually install graphics drivers, etc. My wireless card worked, upgrading my graphics drivers was as simple as a few clicks in the GUI, and turning on Compiz effects was as a dream.Props to the Ubuntu team for making this the best Linux distro ever.
