I needed a version of <a href="http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/">Lightbox</a> that handled real web page urls instead of just images, so I hacked it myself. I looked into using <a href="http://particletree.com/features/lightbox-gone-wild/">Lightbox Gone Wild</a>, but it seemed a misnomer; it's more like a stripped down version of Lightbox. I like the effects and transitions of Lightbox, so I figured why not start there?I'd love to show you an example, but I don't have a host for it right now. Just imagine Lightbox that's capable of showing any URL you throw at it.<ol>	<li><a href="http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/#download">Download the original.</a></li>	<li>Replace lightbox.js with my version <a href="http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/posts/show/2382">here</a>.</li></ol>
