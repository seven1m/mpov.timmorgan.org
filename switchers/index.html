I think of people like my dad&mldr; people who never throw anything away and collect every obscure tool they can get their hands on. My dad had a tool for everything. And he would always know which tool would do the job best in any given situation. I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;m similar in a more geeky sense.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been using Ubuntu at home for nearly two years. It serves me well in most of my tasks.</p><p>I use Windows at work. It serves me well in most of my tasks. Being in an all-Microsoft environment, Windows really shines.</p><p>Today I bought a MacBook Pro for my personal use. I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;switching&rdquo; &ndash; in fact, I hope to install Linux and maybe even Windows on the one machine. Why? Because all three are good. And because Apple hardware is awesome. Apple made a very smart move in changing to the Intel processor.</p><p>So the Mac will arrive in four days or so&mldr; I&rsquo;ll let you know how it goes.</p></div></section></main><footer id=footer><div class=copyright>© Copyright
