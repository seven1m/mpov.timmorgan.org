Whoopti-freaking-do. No exchange, no loaner. Three weeks without my beloved MP3 player.</p><p>Secondly, two months then it breaks!? What&rsquo;s up with that? This can&rsquo;t be typical. I hope not. Especially if I only get to enjoy music and podcasts for a couple months at a time with three-week intermissions.<i>Update:</i> After two and a half weeks, I called Best Buy to get an update. Their response: <i>oh yeah, we were supposed to call you; you can come get a new iPod now. </i>That&rsquo;s weird.</p></div></section></main><footer id=footer><div class=copyright>© Copyright
