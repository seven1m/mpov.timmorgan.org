For small apps, it works well. But as my app&rsquo;s authorization needs grew more complex, I realized I needed a different approach to declaring and testing authorization.</p><p>So I went looking&mldr; It turns out that the <a href=https://github.com/nathanl/authority target=_blank rel=noopener>Authority</a> gem is exactly what I was looking for:</p><ul><li>Authority splits out auth logic into individual &ldquo;Authorizers&rdquo;. Each one handles authorization for a single model (or multiple models that behave the same way), with individual methods for each action.</li><li>Authority doesn&rsquo;t try to do too much &ndash; it gives you an organized way to check authorization in regular Ruby code, explicitly, without having to write implicit rules.</li></ul><p>For our app, authorization got much simplified with regular &ldquo;if&rdquo; statements (compare to <a href=https://github.com/churchio/onebody/blob/8c295727388a8ff3392d21301226b3726e7694b4/app/models/ability.rb#L36-L47 target=_blank rel=noopener>this</a>):</p><p>{% codeblock AlbumAuthorizer lang:ruby %}
class AlbumAuthorizer &lt; ApplicationAuthorizer
def readable_by?(user)
# belongs to me
if resource.owner == user
true
# belongs to a friend
elsif Person === resource.owner and user.friend_ids.include?(resource.owner.id)
true
# belongs to a group I&rsquo;m in
elsif Group === resource.owner and user.member_of?(resource.owner)
true
# is marked public
elsif resource.is_public?
true
# I&rsquo;m an admin
elsif user.admin?(:manage_pictures)
true
end
end
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p><p>I like having my authorization logic split into separate classes &ndash; it seems to be a cleaner approach.</p><p>Also, you can have one authorizer depend on another, like so:</p><p>{% codeblock PictureAuthorizer lang:ruby %}
class PictureAuthorizer &lt; ApplicationAuthorizer
def readable_by?(user)
# ask the resource&rsquo;s parent &ldquo;album&rdquo; if this user can read it
resource.album.readable_by?(user)
end
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p><p>Now, there&rsquo;s a lot that Authority does <em>not</em> do:</p><ul><li>Authority doesn&rsquo;t build SQL for you. Unlike CanCan&rsquo;s <a href=https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/wiki/Fetching-Records target=_blank rel=noopener>accessible_by</a>, Authority doesn&rsquo;t give you a way to query all records accessible by the user. Our solution was to <a href=https://github.com/churchio/onebody/blob/ef7f1ab9ea62df0b502b389686a0ca9e339a0ea5/app/authorizers/album_authorizer.rb#L49-L62 target=_blank rel=noopener>build that SQL ourselves</a>, which isn&rsquo;t difficult.</li><li>Authority doesn&rsquo;t give you a way to load and authorize your resources in your controllers. For that, I built <a href=https://github.com/seven1m/load_and_authorize_resource target=_blank rel=noopener>load_and_authorize_resource</a> as a more generic solution. (More about that in the next blog post.)</li></ul><p>&mldr;with these things absent, Authority has a narrow job that it does very well.</p><p>CanCan is still a wonderful tool that I will likely use on a future project, but Authority takes a different approach and is a great tool to have in the toolbelt!</p></div><div class=tags><a href=https://mpov.timmorgan.org/tags/rails>rails</a>
