What&amp;rsquo;s been uploaded to Flickr and what hasn&amp;rsquo;t? Who knows!
I hacked up a quick solution in Ruby and called it Flickr Upload Set.

Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works:</description></item><item><title>What is Quality?</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/what-is-quality/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/what-is-quality/</guid><description>A lightning talk (5-minute) presentation I gave at TulsaWebDevs:
