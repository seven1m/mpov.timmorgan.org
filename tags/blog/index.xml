Church.IO failed to build the community of software creators I dreamed of.
Mistakes were made. This is a retrospective, and an explanation for anyone wondering where we went.

And there were no politics.</description></item><item><title>Migrate Posterous Blog to Jekyll</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/migrate-posterous-blog-to-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/migrate-posterous-blog-to-jekyll/</guid><description>Posterous is set to shut down on April 30th. For the past month, I&amp;rsquo;ve been dreading the move from Posterous to whatever.
Today I bit the bullet and decided to migrate my Posterous blog to Jekyll. There are many reasons I chose Jekyll &amp;ndash; independence from free hosted services is probably the biggest reason.
I chose to use Octopress, which extends Jekyll with a set of sane defaults and a good structure for customizing layout, CSS, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
