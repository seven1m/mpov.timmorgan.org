It&amp;rsquo;s a great product. Yay!
Check-Ins runs on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows machines. Yay!
Dymo label printers are cheap and plentiful. Yay!
Check-Ins can print to a Dymo printer from macOS or Windows, but not from a tablet. Boo!
The problem ðŸ”—We want to print to Dymo printers, which are inexpensive, from an iPad.</description></item><item><title>Church.IO</title><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/church.io/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 20:27:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/church.io/</guid><description>Recently I made the decision to shut down the church.io website (it&amp;rsquo;s now a redirect), delete the corresponding Slack community, and move the GitHub repositories back to my own personal account. Church.IO failed to build the community of software creators I dreamed of.
Mistakes were made. This is a retrospective, and an explanation for anyone wondering where we went.
What Was it? ðŸ”—&amp;ldquo;Church.IO&amp;rdquo; was created in 2011, intended to be a lovely little community of developers and designers who code and craft open source software specifically for churches.</description></item></channel></rss>
