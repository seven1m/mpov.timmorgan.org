If you&rsquo;re like me, a lot. Even if you do click the next page, I would bet you don&rsquo;t click much past page 2.</p><p>For users who see the Web and web apps as a necessary evil, they might be more apt to page through thousands of results rather than think about what they&rsquo;re looking for and change the query. Ditching the pagination links lights up a different part of the brain I would guess (of course I have no idea considering I am only a web geek).</p><p>What do you think? Am I evil?
